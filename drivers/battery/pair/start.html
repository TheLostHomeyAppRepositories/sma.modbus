        <b>This wizard will add your SMA connected battery to Homey</b>
        <br/><br/>
        The app will attempt to locate the device using the SMA speedwire auto-discovery protocol. If this attempt is unsuccessful, the app will display a form allowing you to manually enter the IP address of your inverter.
        <br/>
        If the device is not automatically detected, it typically indicates that your network does not support UDP multicast.

            NOTE! This app uses the Modbus protocol to communicate with the devices, and by default, Modbus is not enabled on the SMA devices. To use this app, you need to enable Modbus; details can be found on the Homey forum.
